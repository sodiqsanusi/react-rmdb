# Check Any Movie Details Online

This web app was a project I decided to build due to me not knowing react.js proficiently.

I saw the project on weibenfalk's website (you can check him out) and used his styling and designs but all the main logic was from my side.

His project and mine has some differences, I'll talk more on them below:

|Weinbenfalk's | Sodiq's     |
| -----------  | ----------- |
| Does not support TV shows, only movies.      | Gives you details on both TV shows and movies.     |
| Has a cool button that extends the trending movies available on one page 😲  | You can change the trending movies pages directly 😞      |
| You can't check adult content | Adult content can be enabled if wanted 🌝|
| Doesn't use any state management system | Uses context API as a state management system |
| Confusing API calls for beginner developers wanting to clone application| Clear API calls for beginner to intermediate level developers (me being a beginner myself)|
| More wonderful generally and original also 👍| Just a cheap knockoff of Weibenfalk's web app 👎|


Yea, so that's it for now...will document more when I've showed the project to my mentor 🙂
